# 👨‍💻 Cognizant Digital Nurture Program – Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the **Cognizant Digital Nurture 4.0 Program**.

This space captures my learning progress, hands-on exercises, and project implementations as part of the program. It includes work done across Java development, problem-solving, and SQL practice to become project-ready for real-world enterprise solutions.

I am actively updating this repository as I progress through each phase of the training. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
